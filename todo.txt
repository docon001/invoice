Todo:

1) Create proprietary login page for login failure.         X
    Similar to FB login after failure on main screen.
    
2) Finalize register modal/page. 
    Overwrite default submit behavior; need to have 
    server side checking of uniqueness, and report 
    back to modal.
    Register page needs error message for email in use.
    Page needs submit blocking for nonmatching inputs.      X
    (SQL not throwing UNIQUE exception)                     X
    Have client side checking for matching email 
    and passwords.                                          X
    
3) Design and create welcome splash page for login.

4) Update the navbar to reflect login status and 
    appropriate display depending on location in the
    system. 

5) Add security
    Email/Password hashing
    Secure pages after login                                X
    
6) Mobile integration

7) Differentiate super vs normal users
    Need to have a way of creating new superusers

8) Super user posting authority

9) Add payment tracking/link databases
    Have some sort of search or way to select which
    person should have payment applied to
    
10) Check balance page navbar doesn't autodrop.
    seems
    
11) Persistent login on checked box only
    Currently it just always keeps you logged in.
